## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

2. Click on the **"Go Live"** button in the status bar (bottom right).
3. The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.

### Without Live Server

You can also run the project by simply opening the `index.html` file:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Double-click on the `index.html` file or drag and drop it into any modern web browser.
